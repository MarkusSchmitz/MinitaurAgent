# MinitaurAgent

# Introduction:
This is a project that aims to train a Reinforcement Learning Agent on the Minitaur Environment.

## The Environment:
The Environment in the pybullet implementation of the [Minitaur](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/blob/master/examples/pybullet/gym/pybullet_envs/minitaur/envs/minitaur_gym_env.py)


## The Library:
[RLlib](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/tree/master/rllib) is used as the Reinforcement Learning library.

## The Goal:
1. Create an Agent that learns to walk
2. Make the Agent walk smoothely in the MinitaurDuck Environment.

## Required Packages
- pybullet
- ray[rllib]
- pytorch
- pandas
- numpy
- requests
